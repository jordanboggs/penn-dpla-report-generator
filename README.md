# Penn DPLA Report Generator

## Requirements

### Node.js
This app requires Node.js. I used version 9.9.0, but more more recent versions should work as well. Follow the installation instructions on [the Node website](https://nodejs.org/en/). If later versions have issues, you can find version 9.9.0 [here](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v9.9.0/).

### NPM
This app also requires NPM, which is installed when you install Node.

## Installation
In a command line, run 
```npm install```
to install dependencies.

## Running Penn DPLA Report Generator
After installing Node, NPM, and dependencies, run
```npm generate.js```
Next, check output.txt for the generated report.
